# Use cache to speed up

# problem
  * when should I get cache?
    -> by daemon, use other shell?
  * how much cache should be stocked?
    -> maybe, only name of files is enough
  * how to get some changes happend online after cached
    -> make daemon while executing?


# use daemon to collect datas
